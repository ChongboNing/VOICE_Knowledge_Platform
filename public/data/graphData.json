Workshops became experiments in co-creating water law, sensors became poetic instruments, and the river became a character in its own story. Through storytelling, sensing, and legal imagination, RiverSync aimed to enable people to reframe their relationship with the river, from passive observers to active stewards.

Voices of local communities, the sounds of Natura 2000 forests, and the contributions of artificial intelligence all work to imagine a future beyond the Anthropocene. Artist Marina Wainer’s Synocene took place in Ulvenhout Forest, a protected nature site in the Netherlands. The project invited people of all ages to take a walk in the woods to explore new forms of interaction with natural ecosystems in a transformed state that questions our appearance, our perception, and our language. ",
        "These participants then worked with an artificial intelligence engine to envision narratives of a more-than-human world. The project embedded AI used as a fictional tool, which allowed the workshop participants to question our anthropocentric vision of the natural world, against the backdrop of a pivotal moment - the passage from the Anthropocene to the ‘Synocene’. A new era where all ‘other voices’ come together, where humanity's relationship with other forms of life or existence has changed.  Participants wore reflective masks, used binaural sound, and interacted with an AI designed to speak as if it were a tree, a mushroom, or a stream - to change perceptions during the walk, as the forest has conversations with them within a fictional framework. These forest characters were intended to spark thoughtful, creative discussions about our relationship to nature, the role of technology, and how we might live more sustainably. ",
        "Over the course of a week in December 2024, 37 participants, ranging from children to conservationists, joined Wainer and her team for forest walks, and AI storytelling sessions. The AI system, designed to speak and respond in Dutch, was specifically built to be accessible to young and neurodiverse users. It allowed people to imagine themselves in dialogue with more-than-human beings, and in doing so, to reflect on their own environmental values. Synocene created a space where communities could come together, listen to the forest, and imagine new narratives about what it means to live well in a changing world.",

It captures data such as water quality, sound, and video, using Raspberry Pi and environmental sensors. The buoy serves both scientific and poetic functions, bridging physical ecosystems with digital representations."
      ],      
      "steps": "1. Foundation, Ideation, Team Expansion and Onboarding: reach out and welcome team members with required knowledge, such as a programmer and designers, to align academic and technical expertise with the project goals. Begin with collaborative ideation sessions, engaging with practitioners such as artists, programmers, and scientists. Use online visual digital platform tools to support collaborative ideating, such as Miro or Canva, for mapping workflows, milestones, collaborative processes and aligning visions. Collaboratively define ecological and aesthetic goals: framing the project around ecological narratives, considering the Rights of Nature, eco-social storytelling, and more-than-human perspectives. Experiment with Generative Design, using tools such as TouchDesigner to prototype and explore generative water patterns for visualizing data.\n2. Workshops and Design Sessions: Initiate the first Design Session to build an inclusive workshop structure, enabling co-creation across disciplines and communities. Host participatory workshops, for example RiverSync hosted TU Berlin and Spore Workshops. Begin with meditations or rituals that centre water as a subject. Plan participatory workshops which include a blend of expert talks, group discussions, and hands-on problem-solving. Integrate diverse perspectives through design workshops - to include river communities, artists, and technologists, using hybrid formats (in-person/digital) for accessibility.\n3. Use Workshop Outcomes to Inform Design: collect field notes, then work to cluster themes, and derive actionable goals from the workshop data and analysis. Embed the ideas directly into the sensor planning.\n4. Creative Development: sketch UI concepts and physical modules (buoys and sensors), bridging form and function. Refine the 3D buoy prototype to meet artistic, ecological, and practical needs. Initiate a visual interface to communicate water quality data engagingly (here, BadBerlin.Info).\n5. Technological Development and Prototyping: Onboard technical collaborators, involving coders and engineers early in the process in order to ensure full integration from the outset. Assign roles based on expertise – such as, from sensor configuration to UI/UX design. Design the Buoy Sensor Module – beginning with sketching by hand, then developing into detailed 3D CAD models, ensuring to emphasize modularity, weatherproofing, and river-specific sustainability. Prototype Data Systems integrating Raspberry Pi, hydrophones, and sensors. Test in controlled settings before deploying in natural environments. Develop UI/UX in Figma, translating concept into visual interface. Focus on accessibility, narrative flow, and live data integration.\n6. Iterative Design and Refinement: Use CAD and 3D modelling tools to design and develop the buoy sensor module. Iterate and develop modular systems for data, sound (hydrophones), and video, centred on Raspberry Pi integration based on findings from prototyping stage. Develop a finalised user interface prototype in Figma, based on user-centred design principles.\n7. Field Testing: Deploy prototypes in real sites for live prototyping and ongoing testing of sensors and power supply, rapid design iteration, and integration of data/audio/video modules in natural river environments. Refine hardware and UX through live data capture and environmental testing. Prove feasibility of real-time data and media transmission, with attention to resilience in outdoor settings. Develop a housing prototype for sensor and Raspberry Pi systems; and identify further needs in power and weatherproofing. Finalize hardware orders for the production phase.",

Scout and map the walking route that will be used for the workshop. Identify a nearby venue for the AI session's part of the workshop and technical needs.\n2. Stakeholder Mapping and Communication: To understand the ecosystem of human and nonhuman stakeholders, Zone Mapping is used (inspired by Anita McKeown's pCr methodology). Create a zone map to visualise stakeholder relationships (e.g., forest rangers, communities, trees, technologies). Use this map to plan communication strategies in advance of the workshop.\n3.Sound Collection and AI Generation: Collaborators here include a sound artist and AI and interaction developer. Record ambient sounds and interviews in situ, within the forest setting. Translate AI-generated scripts and prompts to accommodate local languages (here Dutch).\n4. Forest Workshop: This requires 1 preparation day, 5 workshop days, and 1 debrief day.\nForest Walk (Part 1): Using the route mapped during the scouting step, take slow, sensory walking to heighten awareness of the forest environment. Participants are equipped with binaural sound recordings and reflective masks to alter perception and enhance listening.\nConversational Encounters (Part 2): Invite participants to have conversations with AI-generated \"forest characters\" (e.g., trees, fungi, elements). Offer the option to create their own characters, using accessible chatbot tools. Frame conversations within the speculative context of the Synocene (an imagined future beyond the Anthropocene) to encourage speculative ecological reflections.\n5. Debrief, Reflection and Documentation: Host a closing day for feedback, reflection, and data collection, prioritising open dialogue with participants about their experiences. Archive responses, including both verbal and nonverbal reflections. Gather documentation, such as: photos, sound recordings, sketches, maps, transcripts.\n6. Post-Workshop Creation and Legacy: Further outputs could include: a video of the workshop experience, a long-form video incorporating workshops across multiple sites, a future sound installation or the installation of sounds in multiple locations accessible for participants, sharing outcomes with contributing communities, and evolving this method in new environments, with new voices.",

Account for practical limitations (such as stakeholder availability). Schedule the workshop at a time that accommodates local calendars and holidays.\nZone mapping: Make sure to gain ethical engagement and community consent.\nEthical Reflections: Be adaptive and reflexive, considering questions such as:\nHow is AI being used — as interface or as interaction? Are you inviting reflection or prescribing meaning? How do cultural expectations affect artistic process (e.g., goal-oriented vs exploratory approaches)? What responsibility do you hold in shaping more-than-human voices?\nDocument emerging ethical questions, considering how translation, tone, and cultural specificity affect engagement.",

        "The Biomaterial Workshop Method iterative, generative method - that builds upon each other - using recycled lab and medical materials to create art-based workshops that invite participants into hands-on making, reflective discussion and playful exploration. It blends wet and dry felting, biomaterial crafting, and facilitated conversation to provoke new ways of seeing waste, contamination, care, and reuse in clinical and research settings. Participants range from scientists and patients, to artists and hospital staff, and are guided through accessible, tactile activities that generate community dialogue and creative experimentation."
      ],      
      "steps": "1. Preparation, Planning and Materials: Choose an accessible venue or platform appropriate to your participants ensuring it is an inviting space (e.g. a local community centre, hospital seminar room, museum, gallery studio or online platform). Source and gather safe waste and surplus materials and tools required, potentially via collaborators or partners — for example, wool waste (from lab glassware packaging), bio-digested hospital aprons, agar, synthetic bodily fluids (fake blood, phlegm), UV sterilisation research materials. Prepare a short, informal introduction covering your artistic concept, inspiration (e.g. the bacterial sublime), and workshop itinerary and expectations. Consider and invite participants to form mixed groups (such as scientists, artists, patients, healthcare professionals), and tailor workshop framing to match. Ensure to gain written permission and ethical consent from participants prior to workshops, for their participation, and use of any imagery, photographs, videos, or quotes.\n2. Workshop Structure: Consider the workshop structure – workshops are modular and can be adapted to different materials or contexts. Setup and display examples of sample biomaterials or artworks to create context and invite discussion. Follow the example workshop structure:\nA. Welcome, Framing and Opening Talk: Introduce your artistic practice and themes via a short presentation. Frame provocations: What is waste? What is contamination? What is beauty or usefulness? Provide context and introduce themes around contamination, aesthetics, and material reuse. Encourage curiosity and freedom rather than perfection.\nB. Hands-On Making and Experimentation: (In-Person): Introduce (for example) wool waste and other biomaterials for experimental felting and manipulation, such as bio-digested apron compost and wool felting. Invite participants to use techniques such as wet felting or needle felting, and to create bioplastics and biocomposites: to feel, mix and create, whilst facilitating discussions (see C). Encourage participants to combine textures, colours, and states (e.g. \"dirty\" vs \"clean\") and explore transformations. (Online): Post materials ahead of time (if feasible). Use wool felting via video conferencing software, with discussion prompts throughout.\nC. Collective Discussion, Co-Reflection and Group Dialogue: \"As the hands are occupied, the mind is free to wander and chat\" - use artistic making to prompt discussion and facilitate open dialogue around sustainability in labs and perceptions of contamination. Encourage conversation about sustainability practices in personal and institutional contexts. Raise relevant contextual questions, as per the project and audience, such as: Why are some materials rejected despite being sterile or safe? How does shifting scientific advice affect public trust? How do we react aesthetically or culturally to visible mess? In online settings, ensure to maintain a strong presence and responsive facilitation.\nD. Optional: You could include a Speculative Experiment: Inviting participants to create pieces, exploring the concept of 'visibly soiled' using synthetic materials (such as synthetic blood or phlegm). Include optional speculative design actions (for example, sterilising 'messy' art with UV light). Allow time to reflect on contradictions and transformations.\nE. Closing the Session: Offer time for reflection: written or spoken - encourage sharing of ideas, thoughts, discomforts, insights. Ask participants what they might do differently in their own work or institutions and invite feedback for iterative learning.\n3. Post-Workshop Development: Compile feedback and transcripts, using the findings to: refine future workshop formats, generate new artworks or installations, and engage stakeholders across sectors (for example, hospital sustainability leads, and university labs). Consider public outcomes, such as a film, sound piece, or zine capturing the material and ethical tensions.",      
      "challenges": "Scientific scepticism or confusion: Some participants may find interdisciplinary conversations challenging.\nCultural attitudes toward contamination: The concept of 'visibly soiled' can be provocative so ensure to use care when exploring discomfort.\nEthical limits of material use: Sourcing biomaterial demands transparency and sensitivity.\nPower dynamics: Flatten hierarchies gently but firmly, aiming to empower all voices in the room.\nMore-than-human awareness: Acknowledge the presence and ethics of organic waste, bacteria, and living processes.\nStorage and disposal: Be mindful of how bio-waste is handled, before and after the workshop.",      
      "conditions": "Framing Practice and Approach: Embrace a non-hierarchical, participatory process that centres community input, experimentation, and open-ended outcomes.\nThis entails creating a supportive and exploratory space fostering serious play, shared learning and critical dialogue.\nThis structure allows for a mix of aspects of theory, practice and reflection.\nPositioning and Environment: Foster a friendly, supportive atmosphere with refreshments - offering food and comfort if in-person; or creating space for informal exchange if using online settings.",

        "The Repair and Reuse Textile Sampling Workshop Method is a creative, collaborative workshop approach focused on transforming textile waste—offcuts, scraps, and discarded garments—into new forms through accessible upcycling techniques. It uses fashion aesthetics, cooperative making, and hands-on learning to empower participants with both technical skills and imaginative confidence.",
        "This method can be adapted for varied group settings and is ideal for community studios, fashion schools, and arts-led sustainability initiatives."
      ],
      "steps": "1. Prepare Your Materials and Setting: Gather offcuts, fabric scraps, and unwanted garments (such as, an old pair of jeans). Bring basic sewing equipment: scissors, pins, needles, sewing machines. Have a sample garment on hand to act as a design template (for example, a maxi skirt). Prepare a demonstration (for example, the 'strip foundation piecing' technique - a method where fabric strips are sewn onto a base cloth, building a patchwork surface). If available, bring digital or printed visuals to support visual learning.\n2. Introduce the Concept and Technique: Begin with a short talk, which could: explain the goals of upcycling; introduce specific techniques (such as strip foundation piecing, yarn made from t-shirts or Reverse appliqué); show the sample garment; and discuss possible transformations. This method is guided by fashion thinking - encouraging experimentation while also aiming for a wearable or functional outcome.\n3. Engage in Cooperative Making: Divide participants into small working groups or pairs and begin by constructing small test pieces (such as, using strip foundation piecing). Focus on composition, colour play, and stitch experimentation. Use these sample pieces as templates for scaling up. Transition into a shared transformation task (for example, converting jeans into a skirt). Encourage participants to talk through their process - narrating their decisions, explaining the challenges, and suggesting solutions collaboratively.\n4. Support Creative Decision-Making: Provide encouragement and technical input as needed (for aspects such as garment structure, stitch techniques). Reinforce that experimentation and play are valued, and allow participants to modify the process as they respond to the materials.\n5. Document the Process: Film short clips of the participants working showing 'hands-in-action', voiceovers, or group discussions ensuring to gain ethical consent to do so. Capture both finished outcomes and in-progress moments. Discuss how video and sound clips could be used to share techniques and reach broader audiences (through social media, zines, installations).\n6. Reflect and Share: At the end of the workshops, hold short group reflection sessions asking: What worked and what was more challenging? What would you try next time? How do you feel about the materials you used? Highlight the potential for showcasing outcomes, such as at fashion shows or community exhibitions. Link the discussions to circular fashion narratives, using the workshop as a space to discuss themes of repair culture, mending heritage, and care ethics in fashion.",      
      "challenges": "Repair and upcycling are both technical skills and creative mindsets – this means that it is important to intertwine making with sustainability discussions and reflections. Participants often need structured guidance to get started – but once this initial support is provided, it is observed that many participants flourish when given the freedom to experiment and play.\nCollaborative working helps participants to demystify textile processes or garment construction and fosters peer learning – it may function differently if working with participants on an individual basis.\nDocumenting the processes through media can democratise access to knowledge and inspire others - do ensure to gain ethical consent for use (for example) photography, video, written and spoken feedback from participants.\nIf participants are struggling to visualise the end result of a repair technique - guide them to work in different ways such as using sketching, draping, or pinning ideas onto mannequins or hangers.\nTechnology-assisted learning may be considered, such as the use of QR codes linking to video demonstrations, or audio guides or podcasts for sewing tips and techniques.",      
      "conditions": "Workshop Space and Equipment: Finding and fostering a collaborative environment is helpful in order to encourage a supportive, inclusive space for discussion and shared making.\nBasic workshop setup and sewing equipment is required including: tables, chairs, good lighting, and access to power for sewing machines, access to basic sewing tools including scissors, pins, needles, thread, measuring tape, seam rippers. Access to sewing machines (at least one per 3-4 participants).\nA minimum time of 2-3 hours works well to give space for sampling and collaborative making.\nFacilitator guidance is required, from someone with knowledge of repair processes, garment construction and textile techniques.\nEnsure to allow space for reflection (dialogue) and display (of sample), which could be wall or table space, to share sample pieces and progress.\nMaterials required include: Fabric offcuts, scraps, and remnants, old garments (such as jeans or shirts for transformation), base cloth for repair techniques (lightweight cotton or muslin), garment templates or sample pieces (such as a maxi skirt for reference).\nOptional extras could be added, depending on which repair techniques are being used, including t-shirts (for yarn-making), additional embellishment materials (buttons, trims, patches), as well as audio and video equipment for documenting the process.",

      "steps": "1. Observe and Document Community Practices: Ensure to gain written ethical consent from the community prior to meeting or observation. Then, once consent is obtained, ask to participate in or attend repair/upcycling workshops or community gatherings. Take observational notes on group dynamics, learning styles, decision-making, and collaborative making processes. Record video and audio clips (with permission) to capture key interactions and techniques in real-time.\n2. Brainstorm with the Group: Host a face-to-face meeting and facilitate the group to brainstorm issues around the community setup. Use this opportunity to collect more detail about how the community structures itself and map its partners, resources, venues, challenges, successes, goals and future plans. Give the group pens, paper and post-it notes to write the information for themselves. Ask the community directly to identify other areas that may be missing or need further clarity such as what people do, how they do it, and why it matters.\n3. Create a Digital Community Map: Use a digital tool (like Miro) to depict the key issues identified in the previous step such as activities, values, and interactions. Identify key themes within the mapping, such as improvised learning, peer decision-making, and interpersonal communication.  Share and reflect on the mapping with the community to ensure it reflects their perspectives, feedback and values. This visualisation helps clarify the unique cultural and educational values of the community's work.\n4. Edit and Curate Media Content: Use digital editing software to select meaningful clips that represent: the character of the group, key making processes and examples of learning or collaboration. Add captions, context, or music if appropriate, for accessibility and engagement.\n5. Set Up a Community Instagram or Social Media Page: Create a dedicated Instagram account, adding a biography that explains the group's purpose and invites participation. Upload a profile photo and a few starter posts in order to set the tone of the group and page.\n6. Share Stories and Engage New Audiences: Regularly post short videos, photos, or quotes from your mapped content. Focus on accessible, inspiring, and human-centred content that highlights repair culture. Use hashtags, tags, and location features to expand visibility and reach younger or local audiences.\n7. Support Sustainable Growth: Discuss social media management with the community: who will post, how often, and with what tone. Consider developing a content calendar or offering training to participants who want to co-manage the account. Link Instagram content to other creative outputs like films, exhibitions, or events to maintain relevance and impact.",

The process invites ethical imagination, emotional engagement, and ecological thinking, and prepares participants for roleplay exercises and games. "
      ],
      "steps": "1. Preparation and Participant Recruitment: Circulate a Call for Participants (CFP) via networks, social media, and community partners – ensuring to use clear, inclusive language. Clarify the workshop intentions in all outreach, explaining that this is an opportunity for collaborative reflection and creative practice, and not a performative acting workshop. Prepare a Character Development Sheet or workbook, which should include reflective prompts, simple guidance, and space for drawing or writing.\n2. Scaffolding and Introducing the Concept of the Mentor Species: Begin the session with a gentle introduction to the 'Mentor Species' idea, discussing non-human beings who offer perspective on ecological, ethical, or emotional realities. Emphasise that these species may be: stressed or sick (due to climate, political, or systemic crises); resilient, adaptive, or vulnerable; engaged in complex relationships such as mutualist, competitive, parasitic, or cooperative, with both humans and other species.\n3. Reflective Character Building: invite participants to choose or be assigned a species (non-human animal, plant, or even microbe). Use guided prompts to reflect on questions, such as: How is this species doing right now? What might be causing stress or thriving? What does it feel like in their body or environment? What do they know that humans might not? What are their relationships to other life forms (including humans)? Here, try to avoid anthropomorphism unless intentionally used to provoke reflection. Instead, encourage imaginative empathy rooted in ecology.\n4. Introduce Ethical and Political Dimensions: encourage participants to consider the following reflections as prompts - how their species' experience intersects with human systems (e.g., capitalism, colonialism, extractivism); what their species might say about justice, care, or responsibility; how this perspective changes their own understanding of the Earth crisis. You might want to reference thinkers such as Robin Wall Kimmerer (traditional and scientific knowledges), Donaldson and Kymlicka (around animal rights and interspecies justice), and Maria Puig de la Bellacasa (environmental ethics and matters of care).\n5. Support Roleplay Preparation: ensure to help participants develop the character's voice, considering - how do they speak, move, and express themselves? Explore how the species interacts with others, including potential conflict, solidarity, misunderstanding or curiosity. Begin gentle, low-pressure exercises to embody or represent their species in group contexts.\n6. Facilitate Dialogue, Reflections and Mutual Learning: allow time for participants to share their character reflections in pairs or small groups. Use this moment to shift from individual insight to collective understanding, asking critical questions such as: what do we learn from each other's species? How might their relationships mirror or critique human systems?",

      "This method combines guided meditation and roleplay-based sharing to help participants develop empathy for non-human life forms (here, 'mentor species') while exploring systemic environmental issues. Grounded in somatic and imaginative practice, the method creates space to reflect on grief, justice, and co-existence in the Earth Crisis (Bridget McKenzie).",
      "The process encourages cross-species listening and collaborative meaning-making, building emotional literacy alongside ecological awareness. It is especially effective when used in intergenerational or youth-centred spaces exploring biodiversity, planetary boundaries, or multispecies justice."
      ],
      "steps": "1. Set the Frame (10–15 mins):\nIntroduce the method clearly and gently, framing it as an imaginative, reflective exercise, not a performance or test. Discuss how participants will be inhabiting the perspective of a non-human 'mentor species' and explain how the purpose is to shift focus from human-centred solutions to relational awareness, grief, and justice.\nShare ground rules: These include ensuring respect for different comfort levels, mindful movement (participants may move during the meditation if needed) and emphasising confidentiality and consent in the sharing circle.\nIntroduce Bridget McKenzie's Earth Crisis diagrams or key concepts (for example, planetary boundaries, societal causes, impacts on lives, tactics and solutions) to give participants a systemic lens for what they may encounter or feel.\n2. Guided Interspecies Meditation (10–20 mins, adaptable):\nChoose one of two formats depending on your group's needs:\nOption A: Traditional Format (Single Flow)\nLead a 20-minute guided meditation helping participants gradually become immersed in their mentor species' world. Begin with somatic grounding (breath, weight, posture). Guide attention into the species' body, senses, landscape. Explore how the species moves, eats, communicates, and interacts. Transition to exploring pressures, stressors, or conflicts the species might face.\nOption B: Adapted Format (Segmented for Neurodivergence)\nBreak the meditation into 3–5 minute segments with short pauses between for mini-reflection or gentle movement. Encourage participants to stand, move, or stim in quiet ways, if needed. After each segment, invite 1–2 words or gestures to reflect what they are noticing. Here, participants can be paired with pre-assigned species based on local ecologies, or allow them to choose species that resonate.\n3. Sharing Circle (20–30 mins):\nAfter the meditation, invite participants to speak in character as their mentor species.\nPrompt questions include: What comes up for you? What feelings and thoughts? What have you learned? What kind of world would support your thriving? How do you feel about human activity or decisions? Encourage participants to listen and respond as their species, developing a shared web of interspecies dialogue.\n4. Collective Reflection and Closure (15–20 mins):\nEncourage participants to shift back to speaking as themselves. Prompt reflections including: What surprised you? Did anything shift in how you see your own role in Earth's crisis? Where do you feel grief? Where do you feel responsibility or hope? Offer participants the chance to write or sketch short responses before verbal discussion, especially for those who process internally. Close with a brief grounding or transition ritual (such as - breath, gesture, shared silence, or nature object offering).",

        "Inclusive Design is a philosophy, movement and methodology that aims to centre those traditionally excluded from design and cultural processes. As defined by the Inclusive Design Research Centre (http://idrc.ocadu.ca/),inclusive design is, “design that considers the full range of human diversity with respect to ability, language, culture, gender, age and other forms of human difference”. It is an approach used by designers, artists, community workers, researchers, educators, and practitioners who want to engage with diverse perspectives to produce artworks, products, or outcomes that are usable by and respectful of the people they aim to serve. Inclusive Design is an approach rather than one specific tool or method. As a foundational approach within the VOICE project, we have gathered multiple tools and methods used within Inclusive Design processes. Many of these methods are adaptable across disciplines and can be scaled depending on context, budget, or stage of project development. For example, Unlearning & Questioning (UQ),  a method for recognising and dismantling internal biases, and Who’s at the Table? / Virtuous Tornado,  a framework for rethinking inclusion and stakeholder presence throughout an artistic or technological process."
      ],
      "steps": "/",
      "challenges": "Some common pitfalls associated with this method include:\n1. Confusing Inclusive Design with Universal Design: Universal Design assumes a 'universal' user and flattens difference. Inclusive Design starts from the edges and prioritizes personalization. Mistaking the two can lead to well-meaning but exclusionary design.\n2. Tokenism: Inviting people in without centering their perspective can create a superficial sense of inclusion. Tools like 'Who's at the Table?'  guard against this by focusing on power and presence.\n3. Unacknowledged Subjectivity: Artists often view their practice as open to interpretation, but Inclusive Design reminds us that our own perspective is also subjective and can benefit from reflection and recalibration.\n4. Unclear ownership: Failing to clarify contributions, authorship and ownership can cause issues later. It is crucial to agree early on how participants will be credited and acknowledged.\n5. Excessive data: Workshops can often yield more data than teams can handle. Even within artistic projects it's important to plan for data management and, where possible, design for future reuse of anonymized material.",
      "conditions": "In preparing to use Inclusive Design within your work it is important to:\n Be open to self-reflection and discomfort\n Plan how insights gained from activities might influence the project's structure, presentation, and legacy\n Research your participants (needs, contexts, preferences)\n Plan inclusive formats for engagement - think about your participants needs and the project's needs when deciding which tools and methods to use\n Prepare materials that are rough enough to invite interaction, overly polished tools can intimidate participants\n Create time for trust-building, onboarding, and clear communication of purpose and expectations\n Plan for consent and data handling, especially if feedback will be reused",

It's especially useful for those who want to move beyond treating other species as objects and instead recognize them as subjects with their own agency.",

While we can't fully know what another species wants, careful observation can help us attune to their presence, impact, and needs. It reminds us that we're always in relation, with microbes, plants, animals, even when we don't realize it."

You're always interpreting from your own perspective, so it's essential to remain cautious and humble.\nAnother important critique is that more-than-human methodologies can overlook human injustice. When people are still suffering, due to poverty or exclusion, it raises the ethical question: how do we care for non-humans while so many humans remain uncared for? This method must always exist within a broader context of justice and responsibility.\nThis approach isn't meant to stand alone.

Zoning: the pCr zoning process maps the information from the stakeholder in proximity to the project and will develop the initial signposts to extend the ecosystem.\n3. The Vital Signs Matrix (VSM) Life Cycle Analysis (LCA): the pCr LCA maps the inputs, processes and outputs of the individual projects and the overall programme; this will be used to ascertain the sustainability and insure an eco-social approach to the project.\n4.
